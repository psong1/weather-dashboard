# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This simple five-day weather dashboard allows users to search for a specific city, and the page will display today's date and weather. It will also show a five-day forecast for that city. The parameters included in the search will provide the temperature (in fahrenheit), wind speed (in MPH), and humidity (in percent). When a user searches for a different city, their previous search will be saved in the local storage and displayed as a button under the search bar. With this feature, the user can go back to their previous search to review the forecast. This information is provided by day.js and the OpenWeather API.
